# VCF Reference Filter

VCF Reference Filter is a robust tool designed to help geneticists and bioinformaticians filter Variant Call Format (VCF) files. Simplify the process of identifying significant variants with precision and ease.

VCF (Variant Call Format) files are a standard format used in bioinformatics to store information about genetic variations. These files are generated after sequencing data is processed through variant calling pipelines, such as GATK, bcftools, or FreeBayes. VCF files are used to describe differences in DNA sequences compared to a reference genome.

The input file should be in .xlsx format. Specify filtering criteria such as quality scores, coverage depth, or specific genomic regions. The software outputs a filtered VCF file containing only the variants that meet the criteria.

## Applications

1. Genetic Studies: Identifying variants where parents differ can highlight potential points of recombination or informative markers for mapping traits.

2. Crop Breeding: Helps identify variants segregating between parents to track inheritance patterns in offspring.

3. Medical Genetics: Differentiating between parent genotypes can uncover de novo mutations in progeny or verify parent-child relationships.

4. Population Studies: Segregating variants are used to study allele frequency and genetic diversity.

## Benefits:

1. Facilitates the identification of informative markers for genetic mapping.

2. Helps in understanding recombination patterns and genetic inheritance.

3. Aids in filtering out non-informative variants in large datasets.
